# Volunteers

Midburn's volunteers module.


### Installation

clone repo

run `npm install`

run `npm start`


### Workflow

Developing branch is `develop`

If you want to build a new feature branch out of `develop`.
Once complete open a new Pull Request back to the `develop` branch.

In this manner we will be able to separate development from production (`master` branch).
