# Volunteers

Midburn's volunteers module.


### Installation

clone repo
1. run `npm install`
2. install and run mongodb locally

Run with spark staging:
run `npm start`

Run with local mock spark:
run `npm run local`


### Workflow

Developing branch is `develop`

If you want to build a new feature branch out of `develop`.
Once complete open a new Pull Request back to the `develop` branch.

In this manner we will be able to separate development from production (`master` branch).
